# Fractal

**What is Fractal?**
> Fractal is a communication and organizational tool aimed at making self improvement efforts AI guided & *fully* autonomous. 

**How does it work?**
> Users can pick any personality or character card, then start talking to them either through voice, text, or even image. During dialogs characters are given a variety of tools for serving the user, whether it be for logging a new event, value, or belief, or retrieving from a database. *Some characters may be resistant to calling tools, often when they are pre-defined to misbehave*. Overtime the character will personalize based on the information it's accumulated from the user.
